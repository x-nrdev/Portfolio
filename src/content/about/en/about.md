Hi there! 👋 

Over the past four years, I have been immersed myself in different projects 
that have **honed my skills** across various technologies 👨‍💻.

As a lifestyle, I love to **read articles** about different types of software development solutions or **watch streams** about new technology trends, frameworks, updates on programming languages, new functionalities, etc 📚.

In my free time I love playing videogames 🎮, going to the cinema and spending time with **family and friends** 👪.
